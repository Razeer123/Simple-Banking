# Simple-Banking
This is a simple Java project from JetBrains Academy platform, that I'm currently working on. It consists of basic tools that are used to generate pseudorandom
card details & PIN number and an option to "log-in" into account to display balance. Card number is checked using Luhn Algorithm. This is my first project in Java.
