# Simple Banking

This is a simple Java project that I made as a JetBrains Academy assignment. It is my first app written in Java language. It simulates a simple banking system with the following features:

 - Generate pseudorandom card number & PIN
 - Card number is checked using Luhn Algorithm
 - Option to log-in and delete an account (data is validated using different methods and classes)
 - Option to add balance and perform a money transfer to different account

All data is stored in an **SQL database**, so after rerunning the app user can still log into account that was created previously.
