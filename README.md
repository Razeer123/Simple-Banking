# Simple-Banking
This is a simple Java project from JetBrains Academy platform, that I'm currently working on. It consists of basic tools that are used to generate pseudorandom
card details & PIN number and an option to "log-in" into account to display balance. Card number is checked using Luhn Algorithm. Users' data is stored in an SQL database, that will soon be improved. Program uses classes and methods to validate user details. This is my first project in Java.
